            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, <code>control</code> structures, and statements. Core JavaScript
                can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>

            <p>avaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of <code>objects</code>, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <li>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. </li>

                <h1>Hello world</h1>
            </header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <p>Here is a example of a code in python <code>def myfun(param):
                        print("everything is funny")
                        print("Previous statement is funny")
            </code> Python looks crazy in writing like english</p>
            <li>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</li>
